<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a civil engineering graduate from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), Sylhet, Bangladesh.

My academic and research work has focused on areas like machine learning applications in geotechnical engineering, seismic risk assessment, and soil stabilization. I’ve been involved in several research projects, which have led to conference papers and ongoing journal work. 
I’m comfortable working with tools like Python, ArcGIS, AutoCAD, and other civil engineering and analysis software. I enjoy writing, organizing complex information clearly, and supporting collaborative projects — whether in research or team settings.
Outside academics, I enjoy graphic design, video editing and occasionally playing the guitar and flute. During my time at SUST, I also served as the General Secretary of AAJ Muktomancho, a cultural organization, which gave me experience in organizing events, leading teams and expressing ideas creatively.
Right now, I’m preparing to apply for graduate studies and continuing to assist in some ongoing research. This website is my way of staying organized and sharing the work I’m involved in.

Thanks for dropping by!
